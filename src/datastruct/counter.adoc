== `collections.Counter`

One of the loveliest collections in the `collections` module of the Python
standard library is `Counter`.  This is an implementation of a concept
sometimes called a _multiset_, _bag_, or _mset_
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset).  A very common use for counters is
in conveniently creating what are often informally called
histograms.footnote:[To be technical, a histogram is a representation of
continuous data divided into _bins_ by numeric value ranges (most commonly
uniformly sized bins).  Similar, but not identical, is a bar chart of the
count or frequency of categorical data.  The utility shown in this chapter is
the latter.]  For this section and the next few, I present the solution (i.e.,
a Pythonic example) first, then the mistake.

=== The Solution

On my personal system, I have a small Python script called `histogram` that I
use relatively frequently.  Let's look at that entire script:

.Source code of `histogram`
[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python
import re
from sys import argv, stdin
from collections import Counter

if '-w' in argv or '--word' in argv:               # (1)
    # Word histogram
    cleaned = re.sub(r'[^\w]', ' ', stdin.read())
    hist = Counter(cleaned.lower().split())
else:
    # Letter histogram
    cleaned = re.sub(r'[^\w]', '', stdin.read())
    hist = Counter(cleaned)

for item, count in hist.most_common():
    print(f"{count}\t{item}")
----

(1) `argparse`, `click`, `docopt`, or `typer` would allow more versatile
switch handling.

I use this utility in manners such as the below (here combined with other
shell utilities, such as `head`):

[source,shell]
----
[BetterPython]$ histogram < frontmatter | head -8
895     e
807     t
766     o
641     n
626     i
618     a
579     s
465     r
[BetterPython]$ histogram --word < frontmatter | head -8
65      the
52      of
47      to
43      a
42      in
42      python
29      and
26      i
----

I might even create a visualization this way, as Figure 6.1 (the similarly
small `barchart` utility, which uses `matplotlib` is available from the book's
website):

[source,shell]
----
[BetterPython]$ histogram -w < frontmatter | head -8 | barchart
----

.Word counts of this book's frontmatter
image::images/word-counts-frontmatter.png[]

The data shown will not be precisely accurate for the final version of this
book's front matter, but it will be similar.  In my script, I merely
initialize a counter with iterables (either of letters or of words), and use
the `.most_common()` method to order the objects being counted.  In larger
programs, you are likely to call the method `.update()` repeatedly on an
existing counter, each time increasing the count for each object in the
passed-in iterable.  The `.subtract()` method decrements these counts.  For
example:

[source,python]
----
>>> from collections import Counter
>>> count = Counter()
>>> count.update("gildings")
>>> count.update("delated")
>>> count.most_common()
[('d', 3), ('g', 2), ('i', 2), ('l', 2), ('e', 2), ('n', 1), 
('s', 1), ('a', 1), ('t', 1)]
>>> count.subtract("antennas")
>>> count.most_common()
[('d', 3), ('g', 2), ('i', 2), ('l', 2), ('e', 1), ('s', 0), 
('t', 0), ('a', -1), ('n', -2)]
>>> del count["n"]
>>> count.most_common()
[('d', 3), ('g', 2), ('i', 2), ('l', 2), ('e', 1), ('s', 0), 
('t', 0), ('a', -1)]
>>> count.most_common(4)
[('d', 3), ('g', 2), ('i', 2), ('l', 2)]
----

All the letters (or any hashable objects) that have never been seen are not
present, but each one that has been seen indicates a number of times.  Once
seen, we might reach a zero or negative count.  Since `Counter` is a subclass
of `dict` it still has all the usual dictionary behaviors, such as deleting a
key, if we wish to use those.

=== The Mistake

If you didn't know about `collections.Counter` you could still implement the
same program, of course.  It would merely be less elegant.  For example:

[source,python]
----
>>> import re
>>> from pathlib import Path
>>> from operator import itemgetter
>>> frontmatter = Path("frontmatter").read_text()
>>> hist = {}
>>> for word in cleaned.split():
...     if word in hist:
...         hist[word] += 1
...     else:
...         hist[word] = 1
...
>>> counts = sorted(hist.items(), key=itemgetter(1), reverse=True)
>>> counts[:8]
[('the', 65), ('of', 52), ('to', 47), ('a', 43), ('in', 42), 
('python', 42), ('and', 29), ('i', 26)]
----

The result we want is definitely achievable without `collections.Counter`.
However, we need to get more clever with comprehensions, custom sort order,
slicing, and so on than if we use a counter.  The non-counter approach also
requires 2-5 lines for each operation that is a one method call on a counter.
