== Mutating An Object During Iteration

You should not mutate objects that you are iterating over.  At times you can
"get away with" it without bad effects, but the habit remains a bad one.

The first thing that we should note is that some Python objects are immutable.
If you iterate over a `str`, `bytes`, `tuple`, or `frozenset` object, for
example, the question simply does not arise of mutating the underlying
collection.

Still, a lot of Python objects are both iterable and mutable.  Most notably
`list`, `dict`, `set`, and `bytearray`, although of course custom or
third-party objects might be both also.  Attempting to mutate during iteration
over an object can go wrong in several different ways:

.Baseline iteration over immutable object
[source,python]
----
>>> s = "Mary had a little lamb!"
>>> for c in s:
...     if c <= "s":
...         print(c, end="")
... print()
Mar had a lile lamb!
----

The toy code is mostly pointless in itself, but we do a selective operation
on only those elements of an iterable that meet some predicate.  One thing we
could certainly do rather than print off individual characters is re-aggregate
those passing the filter into some new collection.  That approach is generally
a perfectly good solution to all of the mutation issues, so keep it in your
pocket as an option.

Suppose we want to try something similar using mutable collections rather than
an immutable string.

.Quick failure in mutation of iterables
[source,python]
----
>>> my_set
{'r', 'M', 'm', 'a', 'e', 'h', 'l', 't', 'd', 'b', '!', ' ', 'i'}
>>> my_set = set("Mary had a little lamb!")
>>> for c in my_set:
...     if c > "s":
...         my_set.discard(c)
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
RuntimeError: Set changed size during iteration

>>> my_dict = {c:ord(c) for c in "Mary had a little lamb!"}
>>> for c in my_dict:
...     if c > "s":
...         del my_dict[c]
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
----

The temptation to mutate these iterables is reduced by hitting a
`RuntimeError` quickly.  However, we are less fortunate for ordered
collections.  Something goes wrong, but the error can be much more subtle and
harder to notice:

.Hidden failure in mutation of iterables
[source,python]
----
>>> my_list = list("Mary had a little lamb!")
>>> for i, c in enumerate(my_list):
...     if c > "s":
...         del my_list[i]
...
>>> my_list
['M', 'a', 'r', ' ', 'h', 'a', 'd', ' ', 'a', ' ', 'l', 'i', 
't', 'l', 'e', ' ', 'l', 'a', 'm', 'b', '!']
>>> "".join(my_list)
'Mar had a litle lamb!'
>>> my_ba = bytearray("Mary had a little lamb!", "utf8")
>>> for i, c in enumerate(my_ba):
...     if c > ord("s"):
...         del my_ba[i]
...
>>> my_ba
bytearray(b'Mar had a litle lamb!')
----

In this code, things appear superficially to work correctly.  No execeptions
are raised.  We genuinely do get a `list` or `bytearray` with some characters
removed.  However, looking slightly more closely we see that one of the `t`
characters that should be filtered out remains in the mutated object.  This
happened because once an element was deleted, the index position no longer
aligns with the actual underlying sequence.  A corresponding problem would
arise with insertion of new elements.

The correct way to approach this requirement is simply to create a brand new
object based on the predicate applied, and selectively append to it.  An
append is a cheap operation on Python `list` or `bytearray` (however,
insertion into the _middle_ of a new sequence can easily hit quadratic
complexityâ€”a danger warned about in other parts of this book).

.Creating new object as a filter of a sequence
[source,python]
----
>>> my_list = list("Mary had a little lamb!")
>>> new_list = []
>>> for c in my_list:
...     if c <= "s":
...         new_list.append(c)
...
>>> new_list
['M', 'a', 'r', ' ', 'h', 'a', 'd', ' ', 'a', ' ', 'l', 'i', 
'l', 'e', ' ', 'l', 'a', 'm', 'b', '!']
>>> "".join(new_list)
'Mar had a lile lamb!'
----

Even more compactly:

[source,python]
----
>>> new_list = [c for c in my_list if c <= "s"]
>>> "".join(new_list)
'Mar had a lile lamb!'
----

Recall that you can also make a (shallow) copy of a sequence simply by taking
the null slice of it.  In slightly different scenarios, `my_list[:]` or
`my_ba[:]` can often be useful as easy syntax for creating a new sequence
containing the same items.
