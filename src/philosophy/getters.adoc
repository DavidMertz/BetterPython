== Getters And Setters 

In some programming languages—notably C++ and Java—a common pattern is to
control access to private or protected variables, but to expose "getter" and
"setter" methods.  In Python it is a mistake to use this pattern, although one
sees such code written by programmers coming from other languages relatively
often.

At first glance, my admonition against getters and setters might seem to
contradict that in the chapter _Advanced Python Usage_, in the section
"Directly accessing a protected attribute."  There I advised against directly
modifying pseudo-protected (i.e. one leading underscore) or pseudo-private
(i.e. two leading underscores) instance attributes.  I use "pseudo-" in the
prior sentence because, of course, in Python you are never truly prevented
from reading or modifying these (other than by convention and mild
name-mangling).  

In so-called "bondage-and-discipline languages" like Java, the intention is to
prevent users of a class from doing something they are not _supposed to_.  In
contrast, a common saying among Pythonistas is "we're all adults here."  That
is, the creator of a class may include _access advisories_ by using single or
double leading underscores, but these are not _access modifiers_ in the style
of C++ and Java (besides "protected" and "private", C++—and Visual Basic
also—includes "friend" as an end-run around other access modifiers).

If an attribute of a Python instance contains one or two leading underscores,
it is not because the creator of the class tries to guarantee you won't
access it, but simply as a way of indicating that the attribute might
disappear in the next version of their class, or its meaning or values might
be altered in ways that are not guaranteed by documented and public APIs.
Also, perhaps the meaning of that attribute with an access advisory might
actually do something subtly different than what you might initially assume.
The class author is making you no promises about that attribute.

Circling back to getters and setters, let's look at a quick example of such an
anti-pattern in Python.  The following _works_, of course; it merely feels
non-idiomatic.

.Writing Java in Python anti-pattern
[source,python]
----
class GetterSetterExample:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self._value = value

    def get_value(self):
        return self._value

    def set_value(self, new_val):
        self._value = new_val
----

Even if these extra methods took additional actions, this would not feel like
good Python.  Yes, you should not muck with `._value` , but if an indirect
mechanism to have guarded access to it is needed, *properties* provide a much
more natural style.

'''

For a slightly more fleshed out example than `GetterSetterExample`, let's
suppose we want a Rectangle class, but with the special constraint that if we
imagine the rectangle having a lower-left corner at the origin, no part of the
rectangle falls outside a circle with a given radius.  This is illustrated in
Figure 5.1. In Pythonic style, we might write this as:

.Valid and invalid rectangles according to diagonal length rule

.Writing Pythonic Python
[source,python]
----
from sys import stderr
from math import sqrt

class BoundedRectangle:
    def __init__(self, x, y, radius=1):
        assert x > 0 and y > 0 and radius > 0      # (1)
        assert sqrt(x**2 + y**2) <= radius
        self._x = x
        self._y = y
        self._radius = radius                      # (2)

    @property
    def x(self):
        return self._x

    @x.setter                                      # (3)
    def x(self, new_x):
        if new_x < 0 or sqrt(new_x**2 + self._y**2) > self._radius:
            print("Rectangle bounds violated", file=stderr)
            return
        self._x = new_x

    @property
    def y(self):
        return self._y

    @y.setter
    def y(self, new_y):
        if new_y < 0 or sqrt(new_y**2 + self._x**2) > self._radius:
            print("Rectangle bounds violated", file=stderr)
            return
        self._y = new_y

    @property
    def area(self):
        return self._x * self._y
----

(1) Production code might do something more than assert invariants.

(2) By design, no mechanism is provided to change radius after initialization.

(3) A "setter" still has that name in its decorator, but not in its API.

It wouldn't be unreasonable to notice that we saved no code in defining the
class, nor even did it become more readable or obvious.  The Pythonic savings
are for *users* of the class:

[source,python]
----
>>> from BoundedRectangle import BoundedRectangle
>>> rect = BoundedRectangle(0.65, 0.30)
>>> rect.x, rect.y, rect.area
(0.65, 0.3, 0.195)
>>> rect.y = 0.25
>>> rect.x, rect.y, rect.area
(0.65, 0.25, 0.1625)
>>> rect.y = 0.8
Rectangle bounds violated
>>> rect.x, rect.y, rect.area
(0.65, 0.25, 0.1625)
----

The quick summary of this section is that using properties—either read-only as
with `.area` or read/write as with `.x` and +++<code>.y</code>+++—provides a
simpler and more Pythonic API for users of classes.  It remains the case that
accessing "protected" attributes such as +++<code>._radius</code>+++ violates
the _advice_ of the class creator and might produce unpredictable behavior
(i.e. in this particular class, the radius is intended to be set only on
initialization).
