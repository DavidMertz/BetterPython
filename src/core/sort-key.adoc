==  Optional Argument `key` To `.sort()` And `sorted()`

Using the optional `key` argument to `sorted()` and `list.sort()` can make
your code cleaner, faster, and more robust.  Failing to use a `key` function,
where relevant is a common mistake.

The requirements for sorting collections or iterables in Python is suprisingly
minimal.  Each object must be able to perform a _less than_ comparison with
the objects adjacent to it in a sequence. 

[NOTE]
.The pointy edges of sorting
====
Not all objects can be compared for less-than inequality, which can
occasionally have the surprising effect that the sortability of a sequence
depends on the original order of elements.  

While this can possibly occur, far more often sorting heterogeneous iterables
simply fails with some variety of `TypeError`.  Still, we _can_ see situations
like this:

[source,python]
----
>>> sorted([5, Strange(), 1, Strange(), 2+3j])
[1, 5, StrangeObject, StrangeObject, (2+3j)]
>>> sorted([5, Strange(), 2+3j, Strange(), 1])
[1, 5, StrangeObject, StrangeObject, (2+3j)]
>>> sorted([5, Strange(), 1, 2+3j, Strange()])
Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'complex' and 'int'
----

To really understand when this will succeed and when it will fail, for a given
sequence of objects that are partially incompatible, you need to understand
the details of the Timsort algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort).
Doing so is a worthwhile goal, but is not required to understand anything in
this book.
====

Given that all we need is less-than inquality, providing sortability of custom
objects is extremely easy to make available.  For example:

.Creating custom objects that can be sorted
[source,python]
----
>>> class Thing:
...     def __init__(self, value):
...         self.value = value
...     def __lt__(self, other):
...         return self.value < other.value
...     def __repr__(self):
...         return f"Thing({self.value})"
...
>>> sorted([Thing(2), Thing(-17), Thing(55), Thing(7)])
[Thing(-17), Thing(2), Thing(7), Thing(55)]
>>> things = [Thing(2), Thing(-17), Thing(55), Thing(7)]
>>> things.sort()
>>> things
[Thing(-17), Thing(2), Thing(7), Thing(55)]
----

A more useful "thing" would presumably have additional attributes and methods,
but this suffices to show the scaffolding needed (the
+++<code>.__repr__()</code>+++ is optional, but it makes for a more attractive
display).

[NOTE]
.Iterables are sortable (if the corresponding concrete collection is)
====
Python really does emphasize iterables over concrete collections wherever they
are feasible to use.  The result of sorting is still a concrete collection,
but the iterable need not have started out as such.  For example:

[source,python]
----
>>> from random import randint
>>> def make_things():
...     for _ in range(5):
...         yield Thing(randint(1, 1000))          # (1)
...
>>> sorted(make_things())
[Thing(544), Thing(651), Thing(666), Thing(799), Thing(920)]
----

(1) The presence of `yield` makes this a _generator function_.

====

If a developer is not aware of the optional keyword argument `key` which can be
passed to `sorted()` or to `list.sort()`, the code they write is likely to
perform inefficiently or just plain wrongly.  In particular, such flawed code
can sometimes wind up sorting on a basis other than the sort order that is
useful for the objects involved.

For example, suppose we wanted to sort "Things" not based on their numeric
order, but rather based on their numeric order within a ring of a given
modulus (called â„¤_n).  A first inclination might be to subclass `Thing` to have
this behavior.

.Unecessary use of subclass merely for sort order
[source,python]
----
>>> class ModThing(Thing):
...     def __init__(self, value: int, mod: int=7):
...         self.value = value
...         self._mod = mod
...     def __lt__(self, other):
...         return self.value % self._mod < other.value % other._mod
...
...
>>> sorted([ModThing(2), ModThing(-17), ModThing(55), ModThing(7)])
[Thing(7), Thing(2), Thing(-17), Thing(55)]
----

There might well be additional reasons to attach the modulus to the class
itself, but supposing we only cared about sorting, we could achieve the same
effect more easily using:

.Using `key` function in decorate-sort-undecorate sorting
[source,python]
----
>>> sorted([Thing(2), Thing(-17), Thing(55), Thing(7)],
...        key=lambda thing: thing.value % 7)
[Thing(7), Thing(2), Thing(-17), Thing(55)]
----

Anything that can represent a consistent transformation of the underlying
objects being sorted is suitable as a key function. The
decorate-sort-undecorate pattern is vastly more efficient as a big-O
complexity than using a comparison function between every pair of items.  See
a discussion at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform.  The less
efficient comparison function idiom is still used in many other programming
languages, and was long ago used in Python, prior to version 2.4.

Lambda functions are absolutely appropriate to use in this context, even if in
most other places a named function would serve clarity better.  But very often
it is useful to use `operator.itemgetter` or `operator.attrgetter` as faster
and more expressive functions than custom lambda functions.  One place we see
this need very commonly is in manipulating deserialized JSON data, which tends
to be highly nested.

.Using `operator.itemgetter` to sort based on a `dict` key
[source,python]
----
>>> from operator import itemgetter
>>> students = [
...     dict(name="Xian", grade="B", age=10),
...     dict(name="Jane", grade="B", age=12),
...     dict(name="John", grade="A", age=15)
... ]
>>> sorted(students, key=itemgetter('age'), reverse=True)
[{'name': 'John', 'grade': 'A', 'age': 15}, 
 {'name': 'Jane', 'grade': 'B', 'age': 12}, 
 {'name': 'Xian', 'grade': 'B', 'age': 10}]
>>> sorted(students, key=itemgetter('name'))
[{'name': 'Jane', 'grade': 'B', 'age': 12}, 
 {'name': 'John', 'grade': 'A', 'age': 15}, 
 {'name': 'Xian', 'grade': 'B', 'age': 10}]
----

For data held in classes `operator.attrgetter` is very similar, but simply
accesses the attribute that is passed as an argument for each instance being
sorted.
