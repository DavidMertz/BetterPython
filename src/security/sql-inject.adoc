== SQL Injection Attacks When Not Using DB-API

SQL injection attacks are a general security vulnerability across almost all
languages that are able to utilize SQL databases.  It's not a _mistake_ that
is specific to Python, but the solution is specifically to use the full
capabilities of Python's DB-API.  Other programming languages and other
libraries or drivers have their own solutions, but in Python, it falls under
the DB-API, which almost all database drivers follow.

Part of what the DB-API provides is a way of passing parameters to an SQL call
in a way that is guaranteed to be safe against injection attacks.  For most
modern RDBMSs (_Relational Database Management System_), the query parameters
are, in fact, passed as a separate stream from the query template.  However,
other than feeling happy that efficiency is improved thereby, you do not need
to worry about that internal detail.  You simply can be assured that the
DB-API and driver module are keeping you safe.

Let's see a simple example of using the DB-API:

.A simple (and safe) example of using the DB-API
[source,python]
----
>>> password = keyring.get_password("postgres", "pw")  # (1)
>>> import psycopg                                     # (2)
>>> with psycopg.connect(
...         dbname='mistakes',
...         host='localhost',
...         user='developer',
...         password=password) as conn:
...     with conn.cursor() as cur:
...         cur.execute("SELECT * FROM wordlist")
...         for record in cur:
...             print(record)
...     conn.commit()
...
('biochips',)
('fluoroacetate',)
('potentialities',)
('steelwares',)
('edacity',)
('platter',)
('pulverizations',)
('entertains',)
('photoionising',)

(1) Per the mistake of putting secrets in source code, a good approach is used
here.

(2) The Psycopg 3 driver to connect to PostgreSQL.

However, there may be quite a few words in this wordlist, so we'd like to
limit it.  Specifically, we'd like to limit it based on a criteria provided by
a user; in our case, users may request to only see words having a certain
prefix.

[source,python]

>>> def some_words():
...     prefix = input("[Prefix]? ")
...     print("-"*40)
...     with psycopg.connect(
...             dbname='mistakes',
...             host='localhost',
...             user='developer',
...             password=password) as conn:
...         with conn.cursor() as cur:
...             cur.execute(f"SELECT word FROM wordlist "
...                         f"WHERE word LIKE '{prefix}%'")
...             for record in cur:
...                 print(record[0])
...         conn.commit()
...
>>> some_words()
[Prefix]? p
----------------------------------------

So far, it is all still straightforward and simple.  But let's try calling the
function another time:

.An injection attack in action
[source,python]
----
>>> some_words()
[Prefix]? ';DELETE FROM wordlist;--
----------------------------------------
----

The problem is not, of course, simply that nothing matches the strange user
input. It's that we actually did the following:

* Select words matching `''`
* Delete *everything* in the table
* Include a final comment of `--'`

An unsanitized user-provided input just deleted the entire content of our
table! Requesting the "e" prefix words ("edacity" and "entertains") shows the
empty table, as likewise does trying the "p" prefix again.

[source,python]
----
>>> some_words()
[Prefix]? e
----------------------------------------
>>> some_words()
[Prefix]? p
----------------------------------------

Randall Munroe's brilliant comic strip XKCD, as often, captures the concern of
this mistake very pithily. We reproduce https://xkcd.com/327/ under its

Python itself also has a wonderful reference to XKCD.  Try typing `import
antigravity` in a Python shell sometime.

Let's repopulate the table with some new words, and try a safer version of the
function.  Showing a special fondness for the letter "b", I ran this query in
the `psql` shell:

[source,sql]
----
mistakes=> INSERT INTO wordlist (word) VALUES
    ('blondness'),
    ('disinures'),
    ('starchily'),
    ('behoveful'),
    ('berming');
INSERT 0 5
----

Before we do that, however, it is worth mentioning that the DB-API actually
allows for several different styles of parameter specification, which drivers
are free to choose among.  These are specified in PEP 249
(https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/).

[%header,cols="1,1"]
|===
|paramstyle
|Meaning

|qmark
|Question mark style, e.g. ...WHERE name=?

|numeric
|Numeric, positional style, e.g. ...WHERE name=:1

|named
|Named style, e.g. ...WHERE name=:name
|format
|ANSI C printf format codes, e.g. ...WHERE name=%s

|pyformat
|Python extended format codes, e.g. ...WHERE name=%(name)s
|=== 

Inquiring into the current `psycopg` driver:

[source,python]
----
>>> psycopg.paramstyle
'pyformat'
----

Armed with that knowledge, let's secure our function:

.A function with query parameters sanitized and protected against injection
[source,python]

>>> def some_words():
...     prefix = input("[Prefix]? ")
...     print("-"*40)
...     with psycopg.connect(
...             dbname='mistakes',
...             host='localhost',
...             user='developer',
...             password=password) as conn:
...         with conn.cursor() as cur:
...             cur.execute(
...                 "SELECT word FROM wordlist WHERE word LIKE %s;",
...                 (f"{prefix}%",))                   # (1)
...             for record in cur:
...                 print(record[0])
...         conn.commit()
...
>>> some_words()
[Prefix]? b
----------------------------------------
behoveful
berming
blondness

(1) The interaction between `%` as an SQL wildcard versus in a Python string
require a bit of special care for this example.

If we try a similar injection with this corrected code, nothing bad happens.
We just get zero results because [.code]``'';DELETE FROM wordlist;--`` isn't a
word in the `wordlist` table.  Or if it _is_ an unusual word, we get the
harmless result:

[source,python]
----
>>> some_words()
[Prefix]? '';DELETE FROM wordlist;--
----------------------------------------
'';DELETE FROM wordlist;--more stuff after prefix
