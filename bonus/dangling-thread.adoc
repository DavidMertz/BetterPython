== Letting threads dangle

On concurrency, leaving a dangling (thread/process/async task) when reading
from a queue: If you have a thread reading from a queue, and you're done with
the thread, leaving it hanging out in a blocked state waiting for a queue item
that will never come instead of finding a way to signal it to close
